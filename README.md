# Avocado-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the seasonal trends in avocado prices and sales volumes across various regions, with a particular focus on conventional avocados in California. Using data visualization and trend analysis, the project explores the relationship between supply (volume) and demand (price), highlighting seasonal effects on avocado markets.

Dataset
The dataset contains avocado sales data, including:

Date: Time of sale
Region: Geographical area where avocados were sold
Type: Avocado type (conventional or organic)
Average Price: The average selling price of avocados
Total Volume: The number of avocados sold
Key Insights
Seasonal Volume Trends:

Conventional avocado sales show clear seasonal peaks and dips.
Higher sales volumes are observed in certain seasons, suggesting a possible correlation with harvesting periods and consumer demand patterns.
Price Fluctuations:

Avocado prices tend to be inversely related to volume. When sales volume is high, prices tend to drop due to an increase in supply. Conversely, prices rise when volume decreases.
Regional Focus:

California data was used as a primary focus to highlight specific seasonal trends, but the analysis can be extended to other regions.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: Data cleaning and aggregation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization of trends over time.
Future Work
Further analysis could involve:

Quantifying the correlation between price and volume.
Applying time series models to forecast future prices and volumes.
Comparing seasonal trends across multiple regions to identify broader patterns.
